# Project: Jogja Coffee Fest â˜•

This project is my attempt to learn state management using _React Context API_ and _Redux_. First I built the app using _Context API_ with the help of _Local Storage_. Then I create a new branch and rebuilt the app using _Redux_.

You can read the development process of building this app in my [blog post](https://halosatrio.now.sh/posts/project-coffee/) **(written in Bahasa Indonesia)**

You can also visit [the app](https://ngopidijogja.netlify.app/) _(deployed on netlify)_
